                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>My name is Tom, an up and coming UX Designer in my final year studying Web Design & Development at Edge Hill University.</p>
                    <p>I am 33 years old and returning to education after 10+ years working various roles within the construction and logistics industries.</p>

            <p>Taking the technical and theoretical skills that I have learned over the past three years, in addition to a wealth of real world experience, I hope to transition a passion for the web into a career.</p>
            <p>I pride myself on my problem solving and logical thinking which equips me perfectly for the User Experience field, making the web better and more accessible for everyone. 
                In addition, over the past three years I have developed a wide ranging skillset for constructing and coding the websites themselves which allows me to mediate between teams and disciplines to enable more realistic design.</p>
            <p>Feel free to navigate to my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page or use my social links to see some of my work. Alternatively, you can <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me directly to discuss any queries you may have.</p>

                <h2>Who I <em>Really</em> Am</h2>
                <p>As I am sure comes with the territory in the web field, I avidly consume anything pertaining to computers. In my spare time I enjoy playing a wide variety of video games, watching streams and youtube content 
                    and generally broadening my horizons through social media, discussion boards and online course content.</p>
                <p>However, a hobby that generally does not come with the territory is my love of Ice Hockey. As a youth who grew up without access to an ice rink, once I had the means to, I was determined to teach myself to skate 
                    and to play the game I had watched from afar.</p>

                <p>Over the course of several years training I was able to reach a point where not only could I play for several teams in and around the North West, I was able to put my leadership skills to the test and 
                    coach my peers as I continued to play with them.</p>
