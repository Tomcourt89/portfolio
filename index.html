                    <p>My name is Tom, a graduate Web Designer, achieving a 1st class honours degree at Edge Hill University in Web Design & Development.</p>
                    <p>I am 33 years old and returning to education after 10+ years working various roles within the construction and logistics industries.</p>

            <p>Taking the technical and theoretical skills that I have learned during my study, in addition to a wealth of real world experience, I hope to transition a passion for the web into a career.</p>
            <p>I pride myself on my problem solving and logical thinking which equips me perfectly to make the web better and more accessible for everyone.</p>

                <h2>Who I <em>Really</em> Am</h2>
                <p>As I am sure comes with the territory in the web field, I avidly consume anything pertaining to computers. In my spare time I enjoy playing a wide variety of video games, watching streams and youtube content 
                    and generally broadening my horizons through social media, discussion boards and online course content.</p>
                <p>However, a hobby that generally does not come with the territory is my love of Ice Hockey. As a youth who grew up without access to an ice rink, once I had the means to, I was determined to teach myself to skate 
                    and to play the game I had watched from afar.</p>

                <p>Over the course of several years training I was able to reach a point where not only could I play for several teams in and around the North West, I was able to put my leadership skills to the test and 
                    coach my peers as I continued to play with them.</p>
