            <h2>The Brief</h2>
            <p>In an effort to support small local businesses during the pandemic I was tasked with choosing a live website of a business local to me that I could redesign to better meet current standards and explore improvements that would help them. 
                To do this I first had to analyse the chosen site and identify:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Who are the users of the site?</li>
                <li>What are the goals of the site?</li>
                <li>What is wrong with the current site and its potential problems?</li>
                <li>What are the potential solutions?</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="figure">
                <div>
                    <p>The website chosen was of a business that I had passed over during the pandemic when I was searching for plumbing services. An assessment of this site provided the following answers to my tasked brief:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Customers looking for plumbing work.</li>
                        <li>To generate business, inform users of their services, provide contact details and promote themselves via third party ratings.</li>
                        <li>Dated and basic look. No mobile design. Information is spread out over multiple pages.</li>
                        <li>Graphical redesign to make it look more professional. Create a mobile design. Page condensing to require less clicks from the user. Make selling points such as services more prominent.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <img src="images/jtb/originalsite.png" alt="Screenshots of the original site to be redesigned">
            </div>

            <p>Additional requirements outside the scope of the task were also considered as further improvement areas. These included:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Quotation and contact options need to be easily visible as the website is only used to make contact with customers but does not generate income on its own.</li>
                <li>Gallery/Services/Testimonials should be on the front page. To set this plumber apart from others their work needs to be seen without pagination.</li>
                <li>Explore alternative colour theory to brighten the mood of the website while still maintaining the "blue" that can be associated with gas flames and water.</li>
            </ul>
